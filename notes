TODO:
    [X] interval should be on goal
    [X] accumulator info should be on goal, get streak template from goal not streaks[0]
    [X] materialize
    [X] add new goal
    [X] new streak fills up until today
    [X] updateInterval form should be select from
    [X] delete goal
    [X] login
    [X] overlay when no goals
    [X] colors (do better materialize in general)
    [X] loading animation
    [X] refactor everything
    [X] edit goal
    [X] change goal color (color)
    [X] sunday (only?) week week doesn't work to add
        fix - were getting number of indexes wrong, needed to start at beginning of interval (would have failed for month as well)
    [X] improve add-goal modal (hide accum at first? pages with questions?)
    [ ] do something with accumulator
    [ ] tooltip hover streak to see goal (hover goal, elipses goal when 2long)
    [ ] handle errors
    [ ] user should be able to pick color theme (reds, blues, greens, their color list will be greens)

    [ ] remove modal (what was this???)
